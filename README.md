## About the Project
In this project is to develop a game that is enjoyable for people of all ages. We really wanted something that would be highly entertaining from ages 5 all the way up. With that in mind we decided to focus on identifying something that could generate just a few seconds of fun and then capitalizing on that. This result is LightFight. 5 minutes of button smashing, rainbow strobing fun. 

LightFight is a two player competitive game that has users smashing buttons as fast as possible in a race to the finish. The game is centralized around a common "Control Light" that changes color randomly. Each user presses a corresponding button based on the color of the Control Light. Each time a user correctly presses a button they are awarded a point. Each time a user presses the incorrect button they lose a point. Correct button presses are Indicated by a flashing "Progress Light". Each Progress light remains on after a total of 5 correct presses. Once all of an individual's Progress Lights are lit the associated player wins.

Our project was completed over the course of three quarters in EE-Emerge. The class is sponsored by Texas Instruments who has been a great supporter throughout our learning process. LightFight has been designed using the Texas Instruments MSP430 Microcontroller and Energia IDE. 

We would also like to extend a special thank you to Sean Alling, EE-Emerge Teaching Assistant, whose instruction has been instrumental to our success.

## Getting Started
This idea came up when Nicholas and Derek were brainstorming together one day. With the ambition of our team leader, **Nick**, Lightfight was born.

## Dependencies

### Required 
In order to build the firmware, [TI Code Composer](https://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/ccs_downloads.html) should be installed. When prompted select to add support for MSP430 and MSP432 microcontrollers.
